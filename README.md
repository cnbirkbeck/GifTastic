# GifTastic

### Disney Giftastic

Disney Giftastic is a dynamic web pafe that utilizes the GIPHY API to populate gifs from a number of buttons or of your choice. 

### How It Works
* Users have the option to click on premade buttons which display a number of Disney characters.
* Once the user clicks the button, the page will populate 10 static gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. 
* When the user clicks one of the still gif images, the gif will animate. If clicked again, the gif will return to it's still state. 
* Above every gif a GIPHY rating will appear, which is provided by the GIPHY API. 
* Alternatively, users may also use the form on the page to add additional characters or search term buttons.
